### Location Search.
To get the weather of a city not shown in the favourites or top cities list, click the search field and type in the location, and then hit search.
You will be navigated to the page for the city, however, if the city isn't found, an error will be displayed.

### Top and Favourite Cities.
The application has a local list of the top populated cities in the world and keeps track of locations that are added to a favourite list. On the homepage, the app shows the temperature information for the top and favourite cities. Clicking on a city name will navigate you to the dedicated page for that city and show more information about that city's weather, as well as notes that have been stored for that city.
